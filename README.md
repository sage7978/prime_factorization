# prime_factorization
simplest c++ code to get factors of prime of numbers
I always try to do something new. So here it goes. My code shown here is completely made by me. It is so simple like sipping a cup of tea. So guys, you will understand this code very easily. If you find any trouble understanding or if you are a newbie, you can paste your question in wiki page. After all, people here arriving just out of curiosity, you can also answer the questions asked in wiki page. Welcome everyone. SIGNING OFF, sage7978................................... 

# Technical things (optional)
Okay guys, my code can find prime factorization of all numbers ;) . But with respect to time constraints numbers below 1e9 can be found like a swift of breeze. So I have also added the code to know the time elapsed in code process. You can manually check that by running code.
You can run this code by running in a cpp ide like: devcpp,codeblocks,sublime text 3,atom & also in an online ide like geeksforgeeks ide,repl.it ide, codechef ide. Choice is yours.
